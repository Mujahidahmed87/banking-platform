   ```

3. **Deletion Policies**
   ```
   - Secure deletion methods
   - Deletion verification
   - Deletion records
   ```

## Disaster Recovery Strategy

### Recovery Objectives

1. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**
   ```
   - Critical services: < 10 seconds
   - Non-critical services: < 5 minutes
   - Batch processes: < 30 minutes
   ```

2. **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**
   ```
   - Financial data: 0 seconds
   - Customer data: 0 seconds
   - Non-critical data: < 5 minutes
   ```

### DR Architecture

1. **Multi-Region Setup**
   ```
   - Primary: UAE (me-central-1)
   - DR: GCC region
   - Active-active configuration
   ```

2. **Data Replication**
   ```
   - Synchronous: Critical data
   - Asynchronous: Non-critical data
   - Continuous backup
   ```

3. **Network Configuration**
   ```
   - Direct Connect
   - VPN backup
   - Route53 health checks
   ```

### Failover Strategy

1. **Automated Failover**
   ```
   - Health monitoring
   - Trigger conditions
   - Failover process
   - Service restoration
   ```

2. **Manual Failover**
   ```
   - Decision criteria
   - Authorization process
   - Execution steps
   - Verification
   ```

## Backup Strategy

### Backup Types

1. **Full Backups**
   ```
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Retention: 30 days
   - Encryption: AES-256
   ```

2. **Incremental Backups**
   ```
   - Frequency: Hourly
   - Retention: 7 days
   - Quick recovery
   ```

3. **Transaction Logs**
   ```
   - Continuous capture
   - Point-in-time recovery
   - Transaction replay
   ```

### Backup Storage

1. **Storage Tiers**
   ```
   - Hot storage: S3 Standard
   - Warm storage: S3-IA
   - Cold storage: Glacier
   ```

2. **Encryption**
   ```
   - KMS encryption
   - Customer managed keys
   - Key rotation
   ```

## Testing and Validation

### DR Testing

1. **Regular Tests**
   ```
   - Monthly: Component tests
   - Quarterly: Full DR test
   - Annual: Business continuity
   ```

2. **Test Types**
   ```
   - Failover testing
   - Data recovery
   - Application recovery
   ```

### Backup Testing

1. **Recovery Testing**
   ```
   - Weekly: Sample recovery
   - Monthly: Full recovery
   - Quarterly: DR recovery
   ```

2. **Validation**
   ```
   - Data integrity
   - Recovery time
   - Application functionality
   ```

## Documentation and Procedures

### DR Documentation

1. **Procedures**
   ```
   - Failover activation
