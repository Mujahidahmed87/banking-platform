   Decision: Hybrid Approach
   - EKS for core banking services
   - Lambda for event processing and notifications
   ```

2. **Database Options**

   **Amazon Aurora vs DynamoDB**
   ```
   Amazon Aurora:
   - Storage: $0.10 per GB-month

   - Advantages:
     * ACID compliance
     * MySQL/PostgreSQL compatibility
     * Automatic scaling
   - Best for: Transaction data, customer records
   
   DynamoDB:
   - On-demand pricing
   - Storage: $0.25 per GB-month
   - Advantages:
     * Millisecond latency
     * Auto-scaling
     * No capacity planning
   - Best for: Session management, high-velocity data
   
   Decision: Use Both
   - Aurora for core banking data
   - DynamoDB for sessions and real-time data
   ```
